# variable naming
# similar to js but no let,var or const
# make code readable, name the variables in a way that make sense
# to separate names use an underscore: user_name


name = 'sai'
print(name)   #prints sai

length = len(name) #gets the length of the string
print(length) # prints the length of the string
